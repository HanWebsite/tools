# Hello from @HowItsHanz

> SSH-KILL and TCP-KILL will work on any server with any specs.
> For the best results use a server with a decent CPU.

# To use these methods simply follow these instructions:

1. Put the methods on your server.
2. Use "chmod 777 *" so you can execute the methods.
3. Run "./SSH-KILL [ip] [port] [threads] [duration]" and "./TCP-KILL [ip] [port] [threads] [duration]" respectively.
